## Building a Three-Tier Application with Docker: A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Because of its scalability and ease of use, containerisation has gained popularity in contemporary web development as a method for deploying programmes. Leading containerisation platform Docker enables developers to package dependencies and applications into containers. Three-tier architecture divides an application into three logical layers: presentation, application, and data. This design provides modularity, scalability, and flexibility. In our tutorial, we will build a simple web application following this architecture. We'll go over how to use Docker containers to create a three-layer website with a front end, a back end, and a database in this tutorial. So let's get started!

### Step 1: Creating Directories and Checking Docker Status

Begin by creating two folders in the main directory: frontend and backend.

Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your system. Make sure it's up to date to avoid any compatibility issues.

### Step 2: Frontend Setup

### Step 3: Backend Setup

### Step 4: Final Integration

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
